### Training
* To train the Input fusion strategy:  
```
python train_singleview.py -s config/singleview_ex.yaml
```
* To train the Ensemble aggregation strategy:  
```
python train_singleview_pool.py -s config/singleviewpool_ex.yaml
```
* To train strategies based on multiple encoders: Feature, Decision, and Hybrid fusion strategies:
```
python train_multiview.py -s config/multiview_ex.yaml
```

## Data

![map](imgs/croph_map.jpg)

The data used comes from https://github.com/nasaharvest/cropharvest. However, we also share the code used to generate the data structures that we used in [data folder](./data).


### Evaluation
* To evaluate the model by its predictions (performance):
```
python evaluate_predictions.py -s config/evaluation_ex.yaml
```


## Installation
Please install the required packages with the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
